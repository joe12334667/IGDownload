Oh!!! how I love dark skin ðŸ¦‹
It never cracks always yummy ðŸ¤—

.if muaâ€™s are to vote something out of make up I promise I would vote brows out without thinking twice ðŸ˜‚
I donâ€™t want to see women who feel like they have to master a cat eye . I want to see women approach beauty in the way that makes them feel like the best version of themselves -fiona stiles .
I always feel normal isnâ€™t for me and that make up shouldnâ€™t have rules attached to it I hope you feel more comfortable  trying new things .
Make up is art 
Make up is enhancing 
Make up is fun ðŸ¦‹
